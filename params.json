  "body": "# OnRamp Project\r\n\r\nThis is the public repository for the OnRamp to Parallel Computing project.  You will find the source code, documentation and modules for running an instance of the OnRamp Server and an OnRamp Parallel Compute Environment (PCE).\r\n\r\nThe OnRamp project provides a web portal interface to parallel compute environments (PCEs) so that users can run parallel codes remotely in a structured and familiar environment.  The web portal provides educational material to learn how to navigate a PCE directly using a series of user levels and examples.\r\n\r\n## Mailing lists\r\n\r\n* [Public User's Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/onramp-pdc)\r\n  * A list for the user community to ask questions and share experiences with OnRamp.\r\n  * **Public** discussion and archives\r\n  * Must join the list to post and receive messages\r\n  * Anyone may join\r\n* [Private Developer's Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/onramp-pdc-devel)\r\n  * A list for the developer community to coordinate OnRamp development activities.\r\n  * **Private** discussion and archives\r\n  * Must join the list to post and receive messages\r\n\r\n## Progress\r\n\r\nThis project is still being designed and implemented.  We hope to have a first implementation available for use on github by Fall 2016.\r\n\r\n## Publications\r\n\r\n* Samantha S. Foley and Joshua Hursey. 2016.
