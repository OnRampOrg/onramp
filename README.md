# onramp
This is the public repo for the OnRamp to Parallel Computing project.  You will find the source code, documentation and modules for running an instance of the OnRamp server and setting up a parallel compute environment it can talk to.

The purpose of the OnRamp project is to provide a web portal interface to parallel compute environments so that users can run parallel codes remotely in a structured and familiar environment.  The web portal provides educational material to learn how to navigate a parallel compute environment directly using a series of user levels and examples.

This project is still being desgined and implemented.  We hope to have a first implementation available on github by then end of the summer 2015.
