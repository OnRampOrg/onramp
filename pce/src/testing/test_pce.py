"""A simple test script for the PCE portion of OnRamp.

Usage: ./test_pce.py

This script is only intended to be run in a fresh install of the repository. It
has side-effects that could corrupt module and user data if run in a production
setting.

Prior to running this script, ensure that onramp/pce/onramp_pce_setup.py has
been called and that the server is running. Also Ensure ./test_pce_config.ini
contains the proper settings.
