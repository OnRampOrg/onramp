PCE Configuration

User-level configuration of the PCE service exists in the onramp/pce/onramp_pce_config.ini file. The file contains two sections: server and cluster. The following paramaters are used:

[server]
socket_host = IP address
socket_port = Port

[cluster]
batch_scheduler = One of: SLURM, PBS, SGE
log_level = One of: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, CRITICAL
log_file = Absolute or relative to onramp/pce


PCE HTTP/JSON Interface

The PCE servivce is made available via the CherryPy web server. The server is contolled via onramp/pce/onramp_pce_service.py commands. Start, stop, and restart are available. When started, onramp/pce/src/RESTservice.py is launched. This script is responsible for initializing the CherryPy web server instance; loading pce configuration from onramp/pce/onramp_pce_config.ini; initializing the service's logger; registering stop and restart signal handlers; tracking the PID of the service via the PIDFile CherryPy plugin; and mapping URL endpoints to HTTP method dispatchers.

The method dispatchers made available to the service live in PCE.dispatchers. This package is the only place in the PCE module where CherryPy-specific code should exist. CherryPy is configured for method dispatching, thus, dispatchers are simply classes that define one or more of GET, POST, PUT, DELETE as functions. The defined functions are then called when a request is made to the corresponding method to the URL the dispatcher is mapped to. The _OnRampDispatcher base class is defined here. This class handles things that most of the PCE dispatchers will need: JSON i/o, logging, and access to the defined logger.

Dispatchers should simply accept requests, parse the request parameters, validate them, use them to make calls to external packages, and return the results. All HTTP errors and request parameter format errors should be caught in a dispatcher. THe PCE service uses the configobj library to acheive this. Specification files for all requests that accept JSON parameters are defined in onramp/pce/src/configspecs. These files are used in conjunction with the configobj library to validate received JSON request dictionaries.
