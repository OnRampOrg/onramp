# A Testing configuration file for module developers
# This file does not need to be in the exported module
#

#
# How to use:
# 1) Setup the tools (may only have to do this once per onramp instance)
#  $$ cd onramp/pce
#  $$ ./onramp_pce_setup
#  -- Note this may take a while as it need to download packages --
#
# 2) Complete this test file
#
# 3) Run the test file (must be from the onramp/pce directory)
#  $$ ./onramp_pce_service.py modtest ../modules/template/tests/modtest.cfg
#

# NOTE ON PATHS: All path settings may be either absolute, or relative to
# onramp/pce.

# Module root folder:
module_path=../modules/template

# Folder to deploy to (module root will be a subfolder of this folder):
deploy_path=~/tmp
module_name=template

# Batch scheduler (current options: SLURM)
batch_scheduler=SLURM

# Number of tasks to configure in batch script
num_tasks=4

# Number of seconds to wait between successive results check calls after job
# is scheduled. If blank, 5 seconds.
results_check_sleep=

# Test script hooks: if any of the following are given, that test script will
# be called at the indicated time. Script will be called with module root dir
# as CWD.

# onramp_runparams.cfg custom section
#
# Config file containing simiulated user entries. Keys/values will be used to
# populate onramp_runparams.cfg.
# Must be absolute or relative to module root folder.
#
