## About this module
The code within this directory accompanies the OnRamp for Monte Carlo Methods Module. Please review the "Drawing Four Cards of the Same Suit" section of the full module document before starting this exercise.

## About this exercise
This exercise explores the probability of being dealt a hand of four cards, with all suits represented. The code includes a function for simulating a traditional "fan" shuffle, rather than assuming a "perfect" shuffle.  This is the most intensive of the three exercises.
