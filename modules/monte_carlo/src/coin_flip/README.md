## About this module
The code within this directory accompanies the OnRamp for Monte Carlo Methods Module. Please review the "Coin Flipping in Parallel" section of the full module document before starting this exercise.

## About this exercise
This exercise serves as an introduction to both threads and random number generators. We will "test" the validity of rand_r() by simulating an increasing number of coin flips and running a chi-squared test on the results.

## Getting Started

    Make
### Run
Sequential version:  

    ./coin_flip_seq  

Parallel version:  

    ./coin_flip_omp  

### Clean Up
