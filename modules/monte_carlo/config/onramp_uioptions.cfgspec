# This file is a configspec file describing the keys and approprate values for
# those keys. The file returned from the server will be a configobj file that
# confirms to that configspec file (so it can be Validated).
#
# The "onramp" section must be named exactly that. You may add additional
# sections and key/value pairs in those sections as needed by your module.
#
# For each key specified the value can be:
#  - blank : Use the default value defined by the OnRamp System
#            This is the "Don't care" case
#  - specification : Specify type, range, defaults, ...
#
# Descriptions of each key should be placed in the doc/
