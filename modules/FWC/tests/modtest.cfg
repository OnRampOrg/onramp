# How to use:

#  $$ cd onramp/pce
#  $$ ./onramp_pce_setup
#  -- Note this may take a while as it need to download packages --
#
# 2) Complete this test file
#
# 3) Run the test file (must be from the onramp/pce directory)
#  $$ bin/onramp_pce_service.py modtest ../modules/template/tests/modtest.cfg
#

# NOTE ON PATHS: All path settings may be either absolute, or relative to
# onramp/pce.

# Module root folder:
module_path=../modules/template

# Folder to deploy to (module root will be a subfolder of this folder):
deploy_path=~/tmp
module_name=template

# Number of tasks to configure in batch script
