# How to use:
# 1) Setup the tools (may only have to do this once per onramp instance)
#  $$ cd onramp/pce
#  $$ ./onramp_pce_setup
#  -- Note this may take a while as it need to download packages --
#
# 2) Complete this test file
#
# 3) Run the test file (must be from the onramp/pce directory)
#  $$ bin/onramp_pce_service.py modtest ../modules/mpi-ring/tests/modtest.cfg
#

# NOTE ON PATHS: All path settings may be either absolute, or relative to
# onramp/pce.

# Module root folder:
module_path=../modules/mpi-ring

# Folder to deploy to (must not exist when test is run):
deploy_path=~/tmp
module_name=onramp_mpi-ring_test

# Batch scheduler (current options: SLURM)
batch_scheduler=SLURM

# Number of tasks to configure in batch script
num_tasks=8

# Number of seconds to wait between successive results check calls after job
# is scheduled. If blank, 5 seconds.
